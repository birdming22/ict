### Samba Client (mount_smbfs)
ref. [Problems mounting samba share in freenas](https://forums.freenas.org/index.php?threads/problems-mounting-samba-share-in-freenas-mount_smbfs.10642/)

    mount_smbfs -I 10.10.101.22 //user@10.10.101.100/folder_shared /mnt/smb_shares

- 10.10.101.22 is the address of the samba client.
- 10.10.101.200 is the address of the samba server. 
- /folder_shared is the folder shared by the samba server.
- /mnt/smb_shares is the folder in the freenas server where I want to mount the samba share
